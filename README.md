# Micro-Project 2  
**Heart Disease Dataset â€“ Correlation and Visualization**

### Extended Description
In Week 2, building on the data preparation work completed in Week 1, I focused on exploring the **relationships between variables** using correlation analysis and visualizations. This step was important to identify which predictors are most strongly associated with heart disease and to guide the selection of features for modeling.  

Key steps included:  
- **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap):** Created a heatmap of numerical variables to quickly identify linear relationships. This helped reveal strong associations between features such as **Oldpeak, MaxHR, and ST_Slope** with the target variable.  
- **Distribution Plots:** Visualized the distributions of numerical features (e.g., Age, Cholesterol, RestingBP) across heart disease status (0 = No, 1 = Yes). This made it possible to observe clear differences between patients with and without heart disease.  
- **Categorical Feature Exploration:** For variables like **ChestPainType and RestingECG**, I plotted group frequencies to better understand how different categories relate to the target.  

By combining correlation analysis with visualizations, Week 2 provided valuable insights into the dataset. This step not only confirmed the relevance of certain variables but also highlighted potential predictors for the upcoming machine learning models.
